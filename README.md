# HCI-Group-Final-Project
 This github serves as a the TechEdge HCI Project, "Furry Friends." The project is a user-centric web application designed to streamline and simplify the process of booking various pet care services, including grooming, veterinary care, pet hotel reservations, pet training sessions, and even pet adoption.

# Functionality
this curent prototype is able to:
- User are able to register/login/send an email if forgot password. Additionally it can also detect if the fields are empty or the password is not matching especially for registering and sending an email when you forgot your password. However, it doesn't have a database so it doesn't really work.
- User can subscribe to the newsletter. However again the only function in here is to detect if its empty or not
- User can view our location in our about us page in google map. However we use Fx Sudirman as the place since Fluffy Friends doesn't actually exist.
- User are able to show and hide within a click of a button in the FAQ section.
- In the adoption page user can view either dogs or cats with a click of a button
